# ATTinySmileyFace
** In Development **
The idea of this project is to develop a cheap microcontroller project for students. 

# PCB Design
The Kicad Project file is provided here in its entirety. You can get three of the boards fabbed up by OSHPark for $20, then solder the components in yourself. (Future work to reduce the price point).

# Arduino Code
You can find a basic Arduino sketch here. The idea is for the kids to make the smiley face eyes flash in whatever pattern they want.

# Simulation
You can open the simulation project at https://wokwi.com/projects/422974727593661441
The students can practice with different code to make the eyes blink, wink, etc. Once they have a pattern they like, we can program their ATTiny and then load it onto their board.
